Carabid community-weighted mean traits data
Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were collected from 80 sites along an urban-rural gradient in Liverpool and Manchester, UK. Specimens were identified to species.

Species mean body size (mm from the tip of the clypeus to the tip of the elytra) was measured as the mean size of individuals captured at all study sites. If more than six individuals of the same species were captured at a site, we randomly selected six undamaged individuals for measuring. Mean relative leg length was calculated (using the same individuals selected for measuring body size) as the combined length of the hind femur and tibia (mm) divided by body size (mm). Latitudinal range (decimal degrees, DD) was calculated using the species’ native distribution as recorded in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org, 2024). For wing morphology, species were initially categorised as either macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged) or dimorphic using existing literature (Lindroth, 1992; Luff, 1998; Turin, 2000). We then examined the wing morphology of specimens of our eight dimorphic species collected from pitfall traps. Specimens of the same species did not vary in their wing morphology, and therefore dimorphic species were categorised as either macropterous or brachypterous based on the wing morphology of all the individuals in our samples. Soil moisture preference (wet or dry) was sourced from literature (Lindroth, 1992; Luff, 1998; Turin, 2000).

For each site, the community-weighted mean (CWM) value of each functional trait was calculated using the proportion of each species found at each site. For example, if four of species A and six of species B were found at a site, and the mean body size of those species were 3mm and 7mm respectively, the CWM body size for that site would be (0.43) + (0.67) = 5.4mm.  

Variables:
site: field site ID
city: the city that site was located in
urban: urbanisation measured as % impervious surface cover
bodysize.weighted: community-weighted mean body size (mm)
rll.weighted: community-weighted mean relative leg length
latrange.weighted: community-weighted mean latitudinal range
wingmorph.weighted: community-weighted mean wing morphology (0 = brachypterous, 1 = macropterous)
smp.weighted: community-weighted mean soil moisture preference (0 = dry, 1 = wet)
